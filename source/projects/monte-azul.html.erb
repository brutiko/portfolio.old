          <h3>RESEARCH AND WORKSHOP</h3>
          <p>The work of the Monte Azul is based on the principles of anthroposophy and Waldorf pedagogy. To give a person the opportunity to develop healthily to its fullest potential and become the man he wants to be, several requirements must be met. 

          Monte Azul provides programs which are divided in different areas of education, health, culture and environmental protection.

          Our research was focused in understanding the role of their philosophy. How do people understand anthroposophy as a human change experiment? How to make the Monte Azul speech more flexible and in a more comprehensive understanding? How to structure thinking actions the future of Monte Azul?</p>
