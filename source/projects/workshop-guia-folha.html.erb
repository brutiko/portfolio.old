          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>Guia Folha is the most complete cultural city guide of São Paulo. In a context of hyperspeed and full-connected society, customers demand new ways of interaction with newspaper and magazines. The tradicional publishing market has a shift on how to engage with consumers and expand digital channels.

          <h3>Design Research</h3>
          <p>During the discovery phase we run a qualitative research to empatise with customers and stakeholders understanding their needs and values. The research gave us a clear perspective of the different environments for journalists, publishers, curators and customers. We also did a quantitative research to get customers opinion and do an internal assessment on Guia Folha's products.</p>
